# Overview:
The Oracle Database CSV Export Project is designed to facilitate the import of biology data of taxons from a CSV file into an Oracle database. The CSV file contains various types of data, including statistics, related to taxons. The project includes procedures to process the CSV data and organize it into different tables such as taxon, site, gathering, fact specimen, etc. Additionally, the project calculates various metrics and creates a "tabla de hechos" (fact table) based on the imported data.

# Features:
- CSV Data Import: Enables the import of biology data from a CSV file into an Oracle database.
- Data Processing Procedures: Includes procedures to process the CSV data and organize it into relevant tables within the Oracle database.
- Table Organization: Divides the data into distinct tables such as taxon, site, gathering, fact specimen, etc., for efficient data management.
- Metric Calculation: Calculates various metrics based on the imported data to provide insights and analysis.
- Fact Table Creation: Generates a "tabla de hechos" (fact table) summarizing the key information extracted from the imported data.
# Usage:
To utilize the Oracle Database CSV Export Project, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation. Once set up, you can execute the procedures to process the CSV data and import it into your Oracle database. Additionally, you can leverage the calculated metrics and analyze the data using the generated fact table.
